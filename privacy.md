# The Simple Version

Playlog is designed to be private by default. Your game backlog stays on your device, and we collect very little data. This policy explains what we do (and don't) collect.

---

## What Stays on Your Device

**Your game backlog, progress, and notes** - All of this is stored only on your device. We never see it, can't access it, and don't store it anywhere. If you delete the app, it's gone.

---

## What We Collect

### When You Search for Games
- We process your search to find matching games
- We don't save your searches or link them to you

### Game Popularity
- When you view a game's details, we count it anonymously
- This helps show other users what's popular
- We can't tell who viewed what

### Analytics (Optional - Off by Default)
- **Analytics are turned off when you install Playlog**
- You can opt in through Settings if you want to help improve the app
- If you opt in, we see anonymous stuff like:
  - Which screens you visit
  - When you tap on games or search
  - How long you use the app
- This data is completely anonymous - we genuinely can't identify you from it
- You can turn it off anytime in Settings

### Crash Reports
- If the app crashes, we automatically get a report with:
  - What went wrong technically
  - Your device type and iOS version
  - What you were doing when it crashed
- This helps us fix bugs
- No personal info is included

### Technical Stuff (Railway Hosting)
- Our API runs on Railway, which handles your requests for game info
- Railway sees standard technical data like IP addresses (they need this to route requests)
- We might see IP addresses in server logs, but we don't store or track them

---

## What We DON'T Collect

- No accounts or sign-ups
- No names, emails, or contact info (unless you email us)
- No location tracking
- No device IDs that could identify you
- No access to your photos, contacts, or anything else on your device

## Third-Party Services

We use a few services to make Playlog work:

- **PostHog** - Anonymous analytics (only if you opt in)  
  [Their privacy policy:](https://posthog.com/privacy)
  
- **Sentry** - Crash reporting  
  [Their privacy policy:](https://sentry.io/privacy/)

- **Railway** - Hosts our API  
  [Their privacy policy:](https://railway.app/legal/privacy)

These companies have their own privacy policies if you want to check them out.

## Your Control

**Analytics**
- Off by default when you install the app
- Turn it on in Settings if you want to help improve Playlog
- Turn it back off anytime you want

**Your Backlog**
- It's only on your device
- Delete the app = delete your data
- We never see it

---

## GDPR (European Privacy Rights)

You have the right to:
- Ask what data we have (spoiler: very little)
- Request deletion
- Object to how we use data
- Get a copy of your data

Here's the practical version:
- **Your backlog data:** Just delete the app
- **Analytics data:** Because it's completely anonymous and we don't create user profiles, we literally can't identify or delete "your" data - it's just aggregated stats

---

## Kids

Playlog isn't intended for children under 13, and we don't knowingly collect their information. If you think a child has shared info with us, let us know and we'll delete it.

Note: Games in the app have various age ratings - parents should supervise their kids.

---

## Changes

We might update this policy occasionally. If we do, we'll update the date at the top. We'll try to keep you informed of any big changes.

---

## Where Your Data Lives

- **Your backlog:** On your device only
- **Analytics:** Stored by PostHog (if you opted in)
- **Crash logs:** Stored by Sentry
- **Game popularity counts:** In our database, but anonymous

We take reasonable security measures, but nothing online is 100% secure.
