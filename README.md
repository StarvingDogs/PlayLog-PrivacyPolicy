**Effective Date:** 1 November 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to PlayLog! Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.

PlayLog is designed to keep your gaming backlog private and stored on your device. We collect minimal data to make the app work and improve it.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Information Stored Locally on Your Device
- **Your game backlog:** Games you add, your progress, and any comments you write
- **All of this data stays on your device** - we don't have access to it and don't store it on our servers

### 2. Information We Collect When You Use the App

**Game Search Queries**
- When you search for games, we process your search query to find matching games
- We don't store your search queries or link them to you

**Anonymous Game Popularity Data**
- When you view a game's detail page, we count that view anonymously
- This helps us show popular games to all users
- We cannot identify which user viewed which game

**Usage Analytics (PostHog)**
- **Analytics are disabled by default** - you must opt in through the app settings to share usage data
- If you choose to opt in, we collect anonymous information about how you use the app, such as:
  - Which screens you visit
  - When you click on games or search
  - App opens and session duration
- This data is completely anonymized - we cannot identify you from it
- We use this to understand how people use PlayLog and make improvements
- You can opt out at any time through the app settings

**Error and Crash Reports (Sentry)**
- When the app crashes or encounters errors, we automatically collect:
  - Technical information about the error
  - Device type and operating system version
  - What was happening in the app when the error occurred
- This helps us fix bugs and improve app stability
- No personal information is included in these reports

**Technical Information from Hosting (Railway)**
- Our API is hosted on Railway, which processes your requests to deliver game information
- Railway collects standard technical data like IP addresses for routing and infrastructure purposes
- We may see IP addresses in server logs, but we don't store or use them for tracking

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- No user accounts or registration
- No names, email addresses, or contact information (unless you email us for support)
- No location data
- No device identifiers that could identify you personally
- No access to your photos, contacts, or other device data beyond what you add to PlayLog

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information described above to:
- Provide you with game information when you search
- Show popular games based on anonymous view counts
- Understand how people use the app to make improvements (only if you opt in)
- Fix bugs and crashes
- Respond to your support inquiries if you contact us

---

## Data Storage and Security

- **Your backlog data:** Stored only on your device. If you delete the app, this data is deleted.
- **Analytics and error data:** Stored by PostHog and Sentry on secure servers in accordance with their privacy policies
- **Game popularity counts:** Stored in our database, but not linked to any individual users

We take reasonable measures to protect your information, but no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

## Your Rights (GDPR)

- **Deletion:** Request deletion of any data we hold

- **Portability:** Request a copy of your data in a portable format

Since most of your data is stored locally on your device and our collected data is anonymous, exercising these rights is straightforward:
